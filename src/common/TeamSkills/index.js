          Why are you an UBE FREAK?

          Ube is a good meme because it just doesn&apos;t mean anything.
          It&apos;s one of the few vegetables that really can&apos;t be associated with anything.
          By itself, it just cannot mean anything. Pineapples are obviously associated with the word,
          we say it a lot. It&apos;s also a root vegetable, along with pumpkins. There&apos;s clear meaning in it.
          Even a less common vegetable like rutabaga is associated with something, like &lsquo;ruting around&rsquo;
          or something. Maybe even the unspoken food like mushrooms and peanut butter. They&apos;re just too familiar.
          <br /><br />
          But ube? It&apos;s just ube. It literally doesn&apos;t rhyme with anything. It doesn&apos;t stand for anything.
          It doesn&apos;t mean anything but it still takes effort to eat. Ube is succinct but also not
          the easiest vegetable to eat in terms of effort. It takes effort to say for how succulent it is,
          and that makes it even more useless and it&apos;s great.
          <br /><br />
          Online, it&apos;s a great way to say something without actually saying anything at all. It&apos;s the
          equivalent of just typing &lsquo;.&rsquo; or just a blank message in a chat, except you&apos;re
          writing something that can be pronounced. It&apos;s brilliant.

          I&apos;ll admit, I was a Google apologist and still love the company&apos;s vision. But this is so much more than Google.
          <br /><br />
          Google is like that 10 you see at a bar and decide to shoot your shot with. You go for him, becase why not? He&apos;s newly
          available when you thought he was locked up forever. So you make a move, and surprisingly he says yes. You&apos;re shocked.
          Complete bliss. Everything is being taken to the next level. He gets your SEO firing on all cylinders.
          The customer experience is amazing. He&apos;s doing things you never dreamed of. Soon, he starts telling people he could
          really see things go seriously with you. But then after a while you start to notice things.
          <br /><br />
          Google starts to act unusual. He says he&apos;s not mad but then starts getting passive aggressive towards you.
          Then if you get upset it&apos;s your fault. He&apos;s into some weird ideas about how he wants to live his life
          that you can&apos;t get on board with. His long term plans start to change, even though he&apos;ll never admit it and
          still says he loves you, but he&apos;s never really there anymore. When you&apos;re at your lowest, he isn&apos;t
          even there to cheer on from the sideline. You get frustrated. You know the end is coming, but you can&apos;t admit it even when
          your friends tell you it&apos;s time. Then, one day, he&apos;s finally gone.
          <br /><br />
          So now you&apos;re back on the market. You&apos;re finally free of some stress, but at the same time you&apos;re alone and lost again.
          You had your whole life planned out with Google, and now he&apos;s run off with the suddenly sexy YouTube. You know, the same YouTube
          who were ugly in high school. Yeah, things really do change, don&apos;t they? So, with nothing else to do, you go out for a drink.
          You&apos;re devastated. You thought you had it all figured out. And then he just up and left you. Not a clue what you want to do now.
          Then all of a sudden you hear a soft and soothing voice. &lsquo;You look like you could use a friend tonight.&rsquo; You turn around.
          It&apos;s Ubeshi. He&apos;s giving you the smile that you give someone when you really care. You tell him all about what you&apos;ve been going
          through, how you got hurt. He tells you that you deserve better, and that someone will be there for you. He takes your hand.
          You smile and take it back. You say thank you and that you really needed him tonight.
          <br /><br />
          Ubeshi takes you home and gets Jada a job. But you tell him you&apos;re still upset. You&apos;re not in the mood. He says that&apos;s ok.
          He leaves the room and you fall asleep. You wake up a little bit later, with a mild hangover. You look around, trying to remember where you are.
          Then you see him. Ubeshi walks through the door. &lsquo;I thought you might want this,&rsquo; he says as he hands you a glass of water. He
          slides in next to you and wraps his arms around you. For the first time in a long time, you feel safe. You feel loved.
          <br /><br />
          That&apos;s the Ubeshi experience. And I cannot wait to see it play out.
